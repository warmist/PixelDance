Nerves/networks:
	* connect/move/disconnect
	* activate to leave pixels

NN:
	* neural network guiding small particles
	* NN working as IFS (instead of a function)


IFS:
	* Add perspective to generation (somehow?)
	http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distancefractals/distancefractals.htm
	* volumetric fractals with raytracing
		* add emission to palette (e.g. >0.8)
		* other material props?
	* fractals on surface (need uv-mapped surface) to raytrace
	* blur based on variation (maybe in downsampled texture)
	* https://www.maptoglobe.com/#
	* Some way of guiding/drawing IFS target
		* maybe flow/vector fields with random movement(?) functions or random physics
		* maybe some sort of texture loading with texture being sdf
	* zoom-regen-zoom-etc...
	* auto-keystops for animation

Cellular automatton and stuff:
	* want to grow plants like https://twitter.com/lorenschmidt/status/1069559544471273472
	* but with trees
	* ecology systems in general
	* (maybe)on gpu for very very fast simulation
		* gpu could do the sand/water/droping
		* cpu for critters/plants
	* Yggdrasil
		* a main tree that `creates` the ecology (i.e. spawns seed species)
		* HUGE
		* maybe having biospheres in itself?
	* sun being not ALL blocked but partially blocked (e.g. leaves vs water vs sand)
	* water plants
	* some way of complete ecology cycles (growth to death to new seeds/critters)
	* crystals
	* metacycles (e.g. crystal life, normal life, dust life, water life, etc...,)
	* slimes
	* light transfer from my dfhack work
	* experiment with different pixels (e.g. split physics/image) for perf

* Lavalamp
* vector drawing thingy, but instead of crisp lines, you get fluid simmed ink (or just fluid simmed stuff)
* Zen garden: draw by dragging stuff through sand
