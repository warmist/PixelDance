	game mechanic exploration based on crystals and crystal-based lifeform.

	factorio like with some rts features. Maybe some procedural generated abilities and co.

	crystal like because this is rewareded:
		- repeating structure
		- symmetries
		- scale symmetry? (hard to imagine how that would work)

	Game phases:
		* expansion
			- grow from seed
			- build infrastructure
			- start the tech tree
		* encounter
			- enemy faction encounter
			- battle over resources and survival
		* domination
			- fully conquer the field
			- exploit resources and optimize the build
		* spore creation
			- final creation to next change the next start
			- sort-of-idle game mechanic of reincarnation/meta progression

	Mechanics:
		* resources
			- energy-like - has no direct map location. "alive" tiles can store for no cost
				- transport energy e.g. diagonally 
			- matter-like - takes up space. storages have dedicated place for it. Movement is difficult?
			- research-like ?
			- supply-like (i.e like in rts supplies) - max unit support
				- supply pixels e.g. two up, one right (thus enforce some sort of structure)
		* interactions
			- growth/assimilation
			- mining
			- energy creation
			- "research"
		* types of "constructions":
			- seed/main crystal - big, has multiple abilities
			- storage crystals
			- support/supply
			- mining?
			- growht?
