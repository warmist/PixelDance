--[==[
	cellular automata magic system or sth

	2 main types with possible subtypes:
		* "protons" - low numbers, define "atom" or molecule "centers"
		* "electrons" - high numbers, maybe loosing them somehow teleporst em back?


	Alt idea:
		no protons, but figure out (??) or encode in rules some "stable arragement" of particles as "proton".
		all non-stable parts are "gamma rays" or sth...
		
	Main idea:
		* Define some conservation laws
		* Generate rules
		* Simulate 100(s) of interactions (i.e. sitting, moving, collision, etc)
		* Statistically model some rules


	Other idea:
		* have complicated thingy
		* remove complication
		e.g. 
			cells have 3 values
			simplified to have 2
