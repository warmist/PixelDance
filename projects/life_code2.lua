	idea:
		* have agents
		* having dna
		* transcribe all of it (maybe starting from random locations)
		* some codes generate signal strengths (e.g. move forward)
		* some codes have preconditions (e.g. food available)
		* some codes are more resistant to mutations (e.g. growth logic)
		* biggest strength gets executed
		* energy for most actions needed
		* some way of breeding/mutations etc
	must support:
		* plants
			- roots(???)
			- trunk
			- leaves (light -> energy)
			- seeds/fruits
		* worms
			- grow
			- move
			- eat (non-armored -> energy)
		* mushrooms
			- grow
			- spores
			- organics -> soil + energy
